# Vanilla Card Balance Checkers

### check balance of vanilla card(s)

this proof of concept also demonstrates how these may be drained, stalked, or worse. for eductional purposes only.

u can google bins, then find (old) cards in dumps, forums, databases, etc.

###### drained - siphon money off card(s) (probably millions lost by vanilla / civilians)

###### stalked - monitor usage of card(s) (amount, who, what, when, where by e.x. abusive people, work, govs, hackers)

###### worse - laundry mat for terrorism? (just read news articles while researching. also, cards randomly popping back up with high balances that were depleted. scams. etc)

##### output:
```
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
...
```
###### carding, hacking, etc is illegal.

maybe a simple captcha could possibly help deter some of it. (most?)

without contradicting the simplicity and ease of activation, maybe a registration/alt login method?
