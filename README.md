# Vanilla Card Balance Checkers

### check balance of vanilla card(s)

##### output:

```
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
$bal cardNumber expMonth expYear cvv
...
```

###### carding, hacking, etc is illegal.

this proof of concept also demonstrates how these may be drained, stalked, or worse. for eductional purposes only.

u can google bins, then find (old) cards in dumps, forums, databases, etc.

###### drained - siphon money off card(s) (probably millions lost by vanilla / civilians)

###### stalked - monitor usage of card(s) (amount, who, what, when, where by bad actors)

###### worse - laundry (cards randomly popping back up with high balances that were depleted)

#### maybe a simple captcha could possibly help deter or at least help track some of it.

##### without contradicting the simplicity and ease of activation, maybe a registration/alt login method?
